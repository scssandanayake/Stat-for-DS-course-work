# Instruction to view and run the Jupyter Notebook

## Rainfall Prediction Application

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files for a rainfall prediction app. The app uses time series analysis and SARIMA/SARIMAX models to predict future rainfall.

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebook files, you need to have the following dependencies installed:


matplotlib==3.8.2<BR>
matplotlib-inline==0.1.6<BR>
numpy==1.26.3<BR>
pandas==2.2.0<BR>
scikit-learn==1.4.1.post1<BR>
scipy==1.12.0<BR>
seaborn==0.13.2<BR>
statsmodels==0.12.2


## Installation Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt <BR>(I have uploded the requirement.txt file already therefore you don't need to manully install each just run this code)

And now you will be able to successfully run the code.
